\jobheader{\textbf{Stratos Technologies}}{Embedded Engineer}
          {May 2014 -- Dec. 2015}
My responsibilities included firmware development, manufacturing
root causing, and test system development for a Bluetooth-enabled payment
platform.  As a cross-functional embedded engineer I was involved in managing
manufacturing engineering efforts, quality assurance, and product development.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed and maintained ultra low power firmware on a PIC18. This
      included a minimal bootloader supporting over-the-air application
      upgrades as well as the primary application
  \item Performed power analysis and accelerated life testing to evaluate the
      usable lifetime of the Stratos card
  \item Re-engineered the software used in manufacturing test. This 
      significantly increased visibility and confidence throughout the 
      electronics manufacturing process
  \item Supported global manufacturing partners remotely and on the factory floor
\end{itemize}
