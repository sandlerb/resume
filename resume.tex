\section{\faWrench\ Experience}
\jobheader{\textbf{Stratos Technologies}}{Embedded Engineer}
          {May 2014 -- Present}
My responsibilities include firmware development, manufacturing
root causing, and test system development for a Bluetooth-enabled payment
platform.  As a cross-functional embedded engineer I am involved in managing
manufacturing engineering efforts, quality assurance, and product development.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed and maintained ultra low power firmware on a PIC18. This
      included a minimal bootloader supporting over-the-air application
      upgrades as well as the primary application
  \item Performed power analysis and accelerated life testing to evaluate the
      usable lifetime of the Stratos card
  \item Re-engineered the software used in manufacturing test. This 
      significantly increased visibility and confidence throughout the 
      electronics manufacturing process
  \item Supported global manufacturing partners remotely and on the factory floor
\end{itemize}

\jobheader{\textbf{Quantum Signal}}{Engineering Intern}{May 2013 -- Dec. 2013}
Contributed to various projects ranging from an in-house reflow oven to robotics
simulation software.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Designed and programmed circuit boards for control systems
  \item Wrote control software for lidar and time-of-flight cameras
  \item Implemented new features in a robotics simulation application
\end{itemize}

\jobheader{\textbf{Intergalactic Mobile Learning Center}}{Research Assistant}
          {May 2012 -- May 2013}
Developed the Personal Instrumentation Environment, an Android-based sensor
kit intended for use in K-12 classrooms.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Designed a microcontroller-based front end for a modular set of sensors
  \item Wrote firmware and an Android application to log data from the hardware
      front end
\end{itemize}

\jobheader{\textbf{Kurdak Research Group}}{Research Assistant}
          {Sep. 2011 -- Sep. 2012}
Ã‡agliyan Kurdak's research concerns the subfield of mesoscopic physics. As a
member of his group I was exposed to low temperature semiconductor research and
provided the technical support to automate experiments.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Programmed the control board and PC front end for a system to analyze the
      properties of an experimental lithium-ion battery network
  \item Measured and analyzed rechargeable lithium-ion battery candidates for the
      proposed network
\end{itemize}
